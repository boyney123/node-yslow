YSlow.js is installed in the code base by default, however,
on installation an install script is run to ensure that the
pathing is setup correctly. This install script does not support
Windows.

Pathing to `yslow.js` is in the Mac / Linux format. As a
workaround you should be able to simply add the following
when initializing `YSlow`.

YSlow.js isntallation isn't supported on Windows. See
http://yslow.org/phantomjs for Windows installation
instructions.


    var YSlow = require('yslowjs');
    YSlow.prototype.script = '/path/to/yslow.js';

If this doesn't work, the failover is to isntall `yslow.js`
(http://yslow.org/phantomjs) and specify the path as shown
above.
